# ASTRA® Automation API

The ASTRA software controls data acquisition and processes data from dilute macromolecular solutions. It
uses this data to calculate the molar mass, radius moments, and other results. All the functionality of
ASTRA is exposed via a user interface that enables end users (such as technicians and researchers) to
interact with the software to perform the above tasks. Whenever the tasks being performed are
repetitive or require minimal human intervention, the ASTRA Automation API enables some automation
to alleviate the human effort.


With ASTRA Automation API, you are in full control of your data, and you can store experiment data files,
data traces, results into your preferred format.


The ASTRA automation API can automate the following:


  - Create new experiments from predefined ASTRA methods

  - Open/save experiment files

  - Collect data via individual measurements

  - Set collection and analysis parameters (e.g., baselines and peaks)

  - Extract data and results from experiments


Performing automation using the ASTRA Automation API requires basic programming knowledge using
Microsoft .NET technology or python. The Automation also supports other programming languages such
as C++ that more advanced users may prefer to the .NET technology.


The ASTRA Automation API comes with a set of components and samples to guide you in building your
automation solution, from performing Autofind baselines and Autofind peaks and extracting results in a
structured XML document, to performing a set of data acquisitions as done in an ASTRA sequence.


The ASTRA Automation API is compatible with Security Pack and will allow loading and saving experiment
files from a Security Pack database.


This integration has been successfully used in commercial projects and the ASTRA team is eager to hear
your automation needs and what you would like to accomplish. Contact our sales team for further details.
